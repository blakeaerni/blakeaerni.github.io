      <description>If you know almost anything about English football, you know that clubs that play in the same city have deep hatred for each other. The rivalries in London are a perfect example of that. The fans of these clubs love to make the claim that “London is (insert color of club)” when their club is having success. While the color of London seems to change every month or even every week in the eyes of the fans, I want to take a look at what color London would be if we looked at the entire Premier League era.</description>
